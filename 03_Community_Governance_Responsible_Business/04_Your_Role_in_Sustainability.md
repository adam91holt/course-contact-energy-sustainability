### The Power of Collective Action

Consider this:
- Our almost 80% emissions reduction since 2012? That came from thousands of decisions and actions
- Our 62,978 native trees planted in FY25? That involved planning, coordination, and hands-on work
- Our top DJSI Asia-Pacific ranking? That reflects performance across the entire organisation

> **Key Insight:** ESG outcomes are built into our DNA at Contact. This starts with each of us taking responsibility for sustainability in our sphere of influence.

## Sustainability in Your Daily Work

### Think Long-Term

Our Tikanga guides us to make decisions our children would be proud of. Apply this thinking to your work:

| Ask Yourself | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| What are the long-term consequences? | Choosing durable equipment over cheaper short-term options |
| Who might be affected? | Considering community impact of operational decisions |
| What would future generations think? | Prioritising environmental protection in project design |
| Is there a more sustainable option? | Evaluating alternatives for materials and processes |

### Apply the Mitigation Hierarchy

When your work involves environmental impacts, follow the same hierarchy we use for major projects:

1. **Avoid**: Can the impact be prevented entirely?
2. **Minimise**: Can it be reduced?
3. **Restore**: Can damaged areas be rehabilitated?
4. **Offset**: Can equivalent benefits be provided elsewhere?
5. **Compensate**: What other measures are appropriate?

### Consider All Three ESG Pillars

Make decisions that consider:
- **Environmental**: Energy use, waste, emissions, biodiversity
- **Social**: Community impact, safety, fairness, inclusion
- **Governance**: Ethics, transparency, compliance, accountability

## In the Office
