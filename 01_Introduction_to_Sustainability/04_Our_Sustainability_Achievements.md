Contact Energy has made remarkable progress on our sustainability journey. This lesson highlights our key achievements, demonstrating that our commitment to sustainability delivers real results. These achievements reflect the collective effort of our entire team and position us as a leader in New Zealand's clean energy transition.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Identify Contact Energy's major sustainability milestones
- Explain the significance of our emissions reduction achievements
- Describe our industry-first initiatives in sustainable finance
- Understand our position as a sustainability leader in New Zealand and the Asia-Pacific region

## Emissions Reduction: A Decade of Progress

Our most significant achievement is the dramatic reduction in our carbon footprint over the past decade.


### The Numbers Tell the Story

| Metric | Achievement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Emissions reduction since 2012** | Almost 80% decrease in scope 1 and 2 emissions |
| **Generation emissions reduction** | 70% reduction over the last decade |
| **Equivalent impact** | Like taking 425,000 cars off the road |
| **Power plants retired** | Three thermal plants closed |
| **Renewable generation** | 90%+ in FY23, 88% average since 2021 |

> **Key Achievement:** Since 2012, Contact's scope one and two emissions have reduced by almost 80%—a remarkable transformation that demonstrates what's possible with committed action.

### How We Achieved This

Our emissions reductions came through deliberate, strategic decisions:

1. **Retiring Thermal Generation**: We closed three thermal power plants, eliminating significant sources of carbon emissions
2. **Investing in Renewables**: We expanded our geothermal, hydro, and wind capacity
3. **Improving Efficiency**: We optimised operations across our generation fleet
4. **Innovation**: We developed new approaches to meet peak demand without fossil fuels

## Science-Based Targets: Leading with Credibility

Contact was the **first electricity company in New Zealand** to set emission reduction targets through the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

### What This Means

The SBTi independently measures our progress to decarbonise and ensures our targets are:
- **Ambitious**: Aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5°C
- **Science-based**: Grounded in current climate science
- **Verified**: Independently assessed and validated
- **Transparent**: Publicly reported and tracked

### Our Verified Targets

| Scope | Target | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Scope 1 & 2 | 45% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions | By 2026 |
| Scope 1 & 3 | 45% reduction in emissions from all sold electricity | By 2026 |
| Scope 3 | 34% reduction in emissions from use of sold products | By 2026 |

> **Important:** Being the first NZ electricity company with SBTi-verified targets demonstrates our commitment to credible, science-aligned climate action—not just aspirational statements.

## Sustainable Finance Leadership

Contact has pioneered sustainable finance in New Zealand, creating new ways to fund the clean energy transition.


### Market-Leading Initiatives

**2017: New Zealand's First Green Borrowing Programme**
Contact established the first Green Borrowing Programme in New Zealand, allowing us to raise funds specifically for environmental projects.

**2019: Sustainability-Linked Loan**
We set up a sustainability-linked loan with terms tied to our ESG performance—demonstrating that sustainability and financial performance go hand in hand.

**2020: First Asia-Pacific Company on Nasdaq Sustainable Bond Network**
Contact became the first company in the entire Asia-Pacific region to list bonds on Nasdaq's Sustainable Bond Network, gaining international recognition for our green finance credentials.

### Why This Matters

These financial innovations:
- Attract investors who prioritise sustainability
- Lower our cost of capital for green projects
- Signal our long-term commitment to sustainability
- Create a model for other New Zealand companies to follow

## Global Recognition: DJSI Asia-Pacific

Contact was ranked as the **top-rated New Zealand company in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) Asia-Pacific**.

### What is the DJSI?

The Dow Jones Sustainability Index is one of the world's most respected sustainability benchmarks. It assesses companies across:
- Environmental performance and climate strategy

- Governance and business ethics
- Industry-specific criteria

### What This Recognition Means

Being top-rated in DJSI Asia-Pacific means:
- Our ESG practices are world-class
- We compare favourably with regional and global peers
- Independent assessors validate our performance
- International investors recognise our sustainability leadership

## Renewable Energy Milestones

Our investment in renewable energy has delivered significant milestones:

### Geothermal Expansion
- **Te Mihi**: Came online in 2014, representing modern geothermal excellence
- **Tauhara**: Now operational, capable of powering 200,000 homes
- **Te Huka 3**: Expanding our geothermal capacity further

### New Frontiers
- **Kōwhai Park Solar Farm**: 300,000 solar panels near Christchurch Airport—one of New Zealand's largest
- **Glenbrook Battery Storage**: Tesla Megapack installation for storing renewable energy

Together, Tauhara and Te Huka 3 add 1.9 TWh per annum at full capacity—a massive boost to New Zealand's renewable generation.

## Environmental Stewardship Achievements

Beyond emissions, we've achieved significant environmental outcomes:

### Biodiversity
- **62,978 native trees planted** in FY25—exceeding our commitment of 20,000+ annually
- **26 major restoration sites** covering 1,000+ hectares
- **3,871 pests removed** in FY25 through control programmes
- **165kg of elver and 296 adult tuna** transferred above Roxburgh Dam

### Water Stewardship
- Commitment to cease cooling water discharge into Waikato River by 2031
- Native Fish Management Programme providing ecosystem insights
- Weekly monitoring of hydrogen sulphide discharge at Wairakei

## Community and Conservation Partnerships

Our sustainability achievements extend to community impact:

### Kiwi Contact Partnership
