![Tikanga and Te Ao Māori](/courses/contact-energy-sustainability/assets/lesson-images/m1_03_tikanga_te_ao_maori.jpg)

At Contact Energy, we recognise that Aotearoa New Zealand has a unique cultural heritage that shapes how we approach sustainability. Our integration of Tikanga Māori and Te Ao Māori principles isn't just about respect—it's about making better decisions that honour our relationships with tangata whenua, the environment, and future generations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Explain the meaning and significance of Tikanga and Te Ao Māori
- Describe how Contact Energy integrates these principles into decision-making
- Understand the concept of kaitiakitanga and its relevance to our work
- Recognise the importance of partnership with tangata whenua

## Understanding Te Ao Māori

**Te Ao Māori** is a holistic worldview that emphasises the interconnectedness between people and the environment. This perspective sees humans not as separate from nature, but as part of a connected system where all elements—people, land, water, and living things—are related.


In Te Ao Māori:
- The natural world has its own mauri (life force)
- Humans have a responsibility to protect and nurture the environment
- Past, present, and future generations are connected
- Land, water, and resources are treasures (taonga) to be cared for

> **Key Insight:** Te Ao Māori aligns naturally with sustainability principles. Both recognise that our actions today affect future generations and that we must balance our needs with environmental protection.

## What is Tikanga?

**Tikanga Māori** refers to Māori customs, protocols, and practices—the "right way of doing things." At Contact Energy, we've adopted Tikanga as a guiding principle for how we operate as a responsible organisation.

Our Tikanga means:
- Making decisions our children would be proud of
- Considering long-term consequences, not just short-term gains
- Acting with integrity and respect
- Honouring our commitments to people and the environment

### Tikanga at Contact

When we say "using our Tikanga to make the best decisions for today and tomorrow," we mean:

1. **Thinking Intergenerationally**: Every major decision considers its impact on future generations
2. **Respecting Relationships**: We honour our partnerships with iwi, hapū, and communities
3. **Caring for Resources**: We treat natural resources as precious taonga, not commodities to exploit
4. **Acting Responsibly**: We hold ourselves accountable to high ethical standards

## Kaitiakitanga: Guardianship of the Environment

**Kaitiakitanga** is the concept of guardianship and protection. It describes the relationship between tangata whenua and the natural world—a relationship of reciprocal care and responsibility.


At Contact, we recognise:
- **The kaitiaki relationship** between tangata whenua and water
- **Our responsibility** to support kaitiakitanga in our operations
- **The need for partnership** in managing natural resources

### Practical Application

Our commitment to kaitiakitanga is evident in how we approach:

**Water Management**
We recognise water as a precious taonga—a resource for all New Zealanders to enjoy and look after. We acknowledge the kaitiaki relationship between tangata whenua and water, respecting Treaty of Waitangi principles in all our water-related activities.

**Biodiversity Protection**
We engage independent ecologists and consult with tangata whenua to advise on and deliver ecological restoration plans. This partnership ensures our conservation efforts respect cultural values and traditional knowledge.

**Resource Consenting**
When seeking consents for our operations, we undertake extensive engagement with iwi, hapū, and communities, ensuring their voices are heard and their concerns addressed.

## Partnership with Tangata Whenua

Contact operates in regions with rich Māori heritage and strong iwi connections. Building genuine partnerships with tangata whenua is essential to our sustainability approach.

### Our Commitments

| Principle | How We Apply It |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Recognition** | We acknowledge Treaty of Waitangi principles |
| **Engagement** | We consult meaningfully with iwi and hapū |
| **Partnership** | We work alongside Māori communities on conservation projects |
| **Respect** | We honour cultural protocols and values |
| **Support** | We contribute to iwi-led environmental initiatives |

### Partnership Examples

**Karearea Release Programme**
Contact supports the release of karearea (New Zealand Falcon) on Tūwharetoa iwi land in Taupō. This partnership combines conservation science with cultural connection to the land, having released six karearea with plans for 15 total.

**Native Fish Management**
Our Native Fish Programme in Central Otago works with local iwi to protect taonga species including tuna (eel) and kanakana (lamprey). Traditional knowledge informs our approach to habitat restoration.

**Wairakei Environmental Trust**
Through our partnership with the Wairakei Environmental Mitigation Charitable Trust (WEMCT), we work alongside tangata whenua to restore and protect ecosystems in the Waikato region.

## Te Ao Māori in New Zealand ESG

In the New Zealand context, ESG increasingly encompasses matters relating to Te Ao Māori and Tikanga Māori. While these concepts intersect with all aspects of ESG, they are particularly important to the social fabric of New Zealand life.

> **Important:** Understanding and respecting Te Ao Māori isn't just about compliance or cultural sensitivity—it's about recognising a worldview that offers valuable perspectives on sustainability, interconnection, and long-term thinking.

## Taonga: Treasures to Protect

Several natural resources are considered taonga in Te Ao Māori and are central to our operations:

### Wai (Water)
Water sustains life and holds deep spiritual significance. Our water stewardship approach recognises wai as a taonga requiring careful protection.

### Whenua (Land)
The land we operate on is more than a resource—it's connected to identity, history, and future generations. We respect this connection in our land management practices.

### Ngahere (Forests)
Native forests provide habitat, clean air, and cultural resources. Our biodiversity programmes include native tree planting and forest restoration.

### Ika and Manu (Fish and Birds)
Native species like tuna, kanakana, kiwi, and karearea are taonga species. Our conservation efforts focus on protecting and enhancing their populations.

## Integrating Māori Perspectives in Your Role

Regardless of your role at Contact, you can contribute to our Tikanga approach:

1. **Learn and Understand**: Take time to learn about Te Ao Māori and local iwi
2. **Show Respect**: Acknowledge cultural protocols and values
3. **Think Long-Term**: Consider the intergenerational impact of decisions
4. **Build Relationships**: Approach partnerships with humility and genuine interest
5. **Seek Guidance**: Consult with colleagues and cultural advisors when appropriate
