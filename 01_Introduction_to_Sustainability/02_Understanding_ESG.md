## ESG at Contact: Built Into Our DNA

At Contact Energy, ESG outcomes aren't an afterthought—they're built into who we are. This starts with three foundational elements:

1. **Our Purpose**: To create a better Aotearoa New Zealand
2. **Our Tikanga**: Our commitment to being a responsible organisation
3. **Our Reliance**: On natural resources, good people, and strong communities to sustain our operations

> **Important:** Every business decision at Contact should consider its ESG implications. This isn't just about compliance—it's about ensuring our long-term success and positive impact.

## Our ESG Reporting Framework

Transparency is essential to accountability. Contact publishes comprehensive ESG information through several channels:

### Integrated Annual Report
Our annual Integrated Report explains how we create value over time and implement our strategy to be a leader in the decarbonisation of Aotearoa New Zealand. This report brings together financial and non-financial performance in one document.

### Climate Statement
Our Climate Statement details how we think about climate change risks, our plans to mitigate these risks, and how we're taking advantage of opportunities presented by the energy transition.

### GHG Inventory Reports
We voluntarily report scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions aligned with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. These reports, available from FY21 onwards, are independently assured to ensure accuracy and credibility.

### ESG Data Portal
Our investor centre provides detailed ESG data covering emissions, biodiversity, water management, and social metrics, allowing stakeholders to track our progress over time.
