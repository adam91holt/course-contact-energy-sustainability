## Our Purpose: Creating a Better Aotearoa New Zealand

At Contact Energy, sustainability isn't just a corporate initiative—it's embedded in our DNA. Our purpose is clear: **to create a better Aotearoa New Zealand**. This means making decisions today that will benefit future generations, protecting our natural resources, and leading the transition to a clean energy future.


As one of New Zealand's largest electricity generators and retailers, we have both the responsibility and the opportunity to drive meaningful change. With over 90% of our generation coming from renewable sources, we're already a leader in clean energy—but we're committed to going further.

## What Sustainability Means at Contact

For us, sustainability means making every decision and action count for the long run. It's about using our Tikanga—our commitment to being a responsible organisation—to make the best decisions for today and tomorrow. These are decisions our children would be proud of, ensuring we look after New Zealand's future.

Our approach to sustainability encompasses three interconnected areas:

### Environmental Stewardship
We rely on Aotearoa New Zealand's precious natural resources—freshwater, geothermal energy, wind, and sun—to generate electricity. Taking care of these resources isn't just good business practice; it's our responsibility to future generations of New Zealanders.

### Social Responsibility
We operate in communities throughout New Zealand and recognise that our actions impact the people around us. From supporting local conservation projects to ensuring ethical practices throughout our supply chain, we're committed to being a positive force in the communities where we work.

### Strong Governance
ESG outcomes are built into our DNA at Contact. Our governance framework ensures that sustainability considerations are integrated into every major business decision, from investment choices to day-to-day operations.

## The Climate Challenge and Our Response

Climate change is a real global challenge already impacting communities, economies, and environments around the world. At Contact, we're committed to taking real steps to address this challenge.

> **Key Commitment:** We have a clear path to achieve **net zero emissions from our generation operations by 2035**.

This commitment places us at the forefront of New Zealand's energy transition. Since 2012, our scope one and two emissions have reduced by almost 80%—a remarkable achievement that demonstrates what's possible when sustainability is a core priority.


## Our Renewable Energy Leadership

Contact has invested heavily in building a renewable, flexible, and reliable generation portfolio. Here's where we stand:

- **90%+ renewable generation** in FY23
- **88% average** renewable generation since 2021
- **70% reduction** in generation emissions over the last decade
- **Three power plants retired**, equivalent to taking 425,000 cars off the road

We're not stopping there. Our pipeline of new renewable projects includes world-class geothermal stations, New Zealand's largest solar farm, and innovative battery storage solutions.

## Supporting New Zealand's Energy Transition

New Zealand has set an ambitious target to reach net zero emissions by 2050. As a major electricity generator, Contact plays a crucial role in helping the country achieve this goal.

Our contribution includes:

1. **Investing in new renewable generation** to meet growing electricity demand sustainably
2. **Retiring thermal generation** as renewable capacity comes online
3. **Helping customers reduce their carbon footprint** through innovative products and time-of-use pricing
4. **Leading sustainable finance** initiatives to fund the clean energy transition

## Recognition and Industry Leadership

Our commitment to sustainability hasn't gone unnoticed. Contact was ranked as the **top-rated New Zealand company in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) Asia-Pacific**—a testament to our world-class ESG practices.

We were also the first electricity company in New Zealand to set emission reduction targets through the **Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)**, ensuring our climate goals align with the latest climate science.

> **Important:** These achievements reflect the collective effort of everyone at Contact. Each team member contributes to our sustainability success through their daily decisions and actions.
