# Our Net Zero 2035 Journey

Contact Energy has set an ambitious target: net zero emissions from our generation operations by 2035. This lesson explores what this commitment means, how we plan to achieve it, and why it matters for New Zealand's energy future.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Explain Contact Energy's net zero 2035 commitment and what it covers
- Describe the key strategies for achieving net zero
- Understand the role of different emission scopes in our target
- Identify the milestones on our decarbonisation journey

## Understanding Net Zero

**Net zero** means achieving a balance between the greenhouse gases we emit and those we remove from the atmosphere. For Contact, this means our generation operations will either produce no emissions or any remaining emissions will be offset through removal activities.

### Our Commitment

Contact Energy has committed that:

> **Direct emissions from our power plants (scope 1), and all emissions from the purchase and use of electricity (scope 2), will be net zero by 2035.**

This is achieved through investment in new renewable generation and the closure of baseload thermal generation.

## Understanding Emission Scopes

To understand our net zero target, it's important to understand the different categories of emissions:

### Scope 1: Direct Emissions
These are emissions we directly produce from sources we own or control:
- Burning natural gas in thermal power stations
- Geothermal emissions (CO2 released during steam extraction)
- Vehicle fleet emissions

### Scope 2: Indirect Energy Emissions
These are emissions from the electricity we purchase and use:
- Electricity consumed in our offices
- Electricity used to power our operations

### Scope 3: Value Chain Emissions
These are all other indirect emissions in our value chain:
- Emissions from products and services we purchase
- Emissions from the use of energy we sell to customers
- Business travel and employee commuting

> **Important:** Our 2035 target focuses on scope 1 and 2 emissions—those within our direct control. Scope 3 emissions will receive greater focus in the future.

## Our Progress So Far

Contact has made remarkable progress on our decarbonisation journey:

| Metric | Progress |
|--------|----------|
| **Emissions reduction since 2012** | Almost 80% decrease in scope 1 & 2 |
| **Generation emissions** | 70% reduction over the last decade |
| **Thermal plants retired** | Three plants closed |
| **Equivalent cars removed** | 425,000 vehicles off the road |
| **Renewable generation** | 90%+ in FY23 |

This progress demonstrates that decarbonisation is achievable—and we're well on track.

## Strategies for Reaching Net Zero

Our path to net zero involves multiple complementary strategies:

### 1. Investment in New Renewable Generation

The foundation of our net zero strategy is replacing fossil fuel generation with renewable sources:

**Geothermal Power**
- Tauhara geothermal station now operational, powering 200,000 homes
- Te Huka 3 expanding our geothermal capacity
- Together adding 1.9 TWh per annum at full capacity

**Solar Power**
- Kōwhai Park Solar Farm near Christchurch with 300,000 panels
- One of New Zealand's largest solar installations

**Battery Storage**
- Glenbrook Tesla Megapack for storing renewable energy
- Enables better use of renewable generation during peak demand

### 2. Closure of Baseload Thermal Generation

As renewable capacity increases, we're systematically retiring thermal generation:
- Already retired three thermal power plants
- Transitioning away from baseload fossil fuel generation
- Retaining some thermal capacity for system security during the transition

### 3. Reducing Thermal Peaking

Thermal "peaking" plants run during periods of high demand. We're reducing reliance on these through:
- **Demand response innovation**: Helping customers shift usage to off-peak times
- **Battery storage**: Storing renewable energy for peak periods
- **Time-of-use pricing**: Incentivising consumption when renewables are abundant

### 4. Carbon Capture and Reinjection

For geothermal operations, we're exploring technologies to capture and reinject CO2:
- Geothermal steam naturally contains some CO2
- Capture technology can prevent this from entering the atmosphere
- Reinjection returns it to the geothermal reservoir

### 5. Forestry Offsets

For any residual emissions that cannot be eliminated, forestry offsets provide a solution:
- Trees absorb CO2 as they grow
- Permanent forests provide long-term carbon storage
- Native plantings also support biodiversity goals

## The Role of Thermal Generation

You might wonder: if we're committed to net zero, why do we still have thermal generation?

### System Security

New Zealand's electricity system needs backup generation for:
- **Dry years**: When hydro lakes are low, thermal provides essential backup
- **Peak demand**: Winter evenings when everyone turns on heating
- **System stability**: Rapid response to sudden changes in supply or demand

### The Transition

Our approach is pragmatic:
1. Invest heavily in renewables to meet base demand
2. Use thermal only when necessary for system security
3. Reduce thermal reliance through storage and demand response
4. Phase out thermal as alternatives become available

> **Key Insight:** Contact views thermal generation as critical for providing flexible, secure generation during the transition—but limited to balancing renewable supply and meeting peak demand.

## Supporting New Zealand's Climate Goals

Contact's net zero journey supports broader national objectives:

### New Zealand's 2050 Target
New Zealand has committed to net zero emissions by 2050. As a major electricity generator, Contact's 2035 target puts us ahead of this timeline.

### Paris Agreement Alignment
Our targets align with the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature increase to 1.5°C. This ensures our climate action is consistent with international best practice.

### Enabling Economy-Wide Decarbonisation
Clean electricity is essential for decarbonising other sectors:
- Electric vehicles replacing petrol cars
- Heat pumps replacing gas heating
- Industrial process electrification

By providing abundant clean electricity, Contact enables emissions reductions across the economy.

## Key Milestones on Our Journey

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 2012 | Beginning of major emissions reduction journey |
| 2014 | Te Mihi geothermal station operational |
| 2021-present | 88% average renewable generation |
| 2024 | Tauhara geothermal station operational |
| 2024 | Kōwhai Park Solar Farm construction begins |
| 2025 | Glenbrook Battery Storage construction begins |
| 2026 | Battery storage operational |
| 2026 | Science-Based Targets interim milestone |
| 2031 | Cease cooling water discharge to Waikato River |
| **2035** | **Net zero generation operations** |

## What Net Zero Means in Practice

When we achieve net zero in 2035, it means:

- **Renewable dominance**: The vast majority of our generation will be renewable
- **Minimal thermal**: Any remaining thermal will be for critical system security
- **Offset balance**: Residual emissions offset through forestry or other measures
- **Continuous improvement**: Ongoing investment in new technologies

## Your Role in the Net Zero Journey

Every Contact employee contributes to our net zero goal:

1. **Understanding our strategy**: Know why we're making the decisions we make
2. **Supporting efficiency**: Help identify opportunities to reduce energy use
3. **Customer engagement**: Help customers understand the benefits of clean energy
4. **Innovation mindset**: Be open to new ways of doing things

## Key Takeaways
