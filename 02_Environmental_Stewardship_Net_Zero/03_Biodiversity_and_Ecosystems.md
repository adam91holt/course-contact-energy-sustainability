# Biodiversity and Ecosystem Protection


![Biodiversity and Ecosystems](/courses/contact-energy-sustainability/assets/lesson-images/m2_03_biodiversity.jpg)

Contact Energy operates across some of New Zealand's most precious natural environments. Our responsibility extends beyond generating clean electricity—we're committed to protecting and restoring the ecosystems around us. This lesson explores our comprehensive approach to biodiversity and ecosystem protection.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Describe Contact Energy's approach to biodiversity management
- Identify key conservation projects and partnerships
- Explain the mitigation hierarchy and how we apply it
- Understand our native species protection programmes

## Our Biodiversity Commitment

Contact recognises that our operations interact with natural ecosystems. We take our responsibility seriously—not just because it's required, but because protecting biodiversity is essential for the health of our environment and future generations.


### Our Approach

We engage independent ecologists and consult with tangata whenua to advise on and deliver ecological restoration plans for:
- Critical biodiversity areas
- Unique ecosystems
- Native species including tuna (eel) and kanakana (lamprey) on the Clutha Mata-Au

## The Mitigation Hierarchy

Contact follows a structured approach to managing our environmental impacts, known as the **mitigation hierarchy**:

### 1. Avoid
The first priority is to avoid impacts where possible:
- Careful site selection for new projects
- Design modifications to protect sensitive areas
- Timing operations to avoid critical periods (e.g., breeding seasons)

### 2. Minimise
When impacts cannot be avoided, we minimise them:
- Reducing the footprint of our operations
- Implementing best-practice construction methods
- Limiting disturbance to surrounding areas

### 3. Restore
We actively restore degraded areas:
- Native planting programmes
- Wetland restoration
- Riparian zone rehabilitation

### 4. Offset
For remaining impacts, we provide compensation elsewhere:
- Habitat creation in other areas
- Species protection programmes
- Conservation partnerships

### 5. Compensate
Final measures to address residual impacts:
- Long-term conservation funding
- Community environmental projects
- Research and monitoring programmes

> **Key Principle:** By following this hierarchy, we ensure that environmental protection is built into every project from the start, not just addressed after the fact.

## Our Restoration Sites

Contact manages **26 major restoration sites** totaling approximately **1,000+ hectares** across New Zealand. These sites represent our commitment to creating lasting environmental benefits.

### Torepatutahi Wetland

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Size** | 37.8 hectares |
| **Focus** | Wetland ecosystem protection |
| **Key Species** | Swamp nettle, fernbird |
| **Status** | Active restoration |

This wetland project protects at-risk plant species and provides habitat for native birds including the secretive fernbird.

### WEMCT Projects

The Wairakei Environmental Mitigation Charitable Trust (WEMCT) manages multiple restoration sites on our behalf:

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Total Area** | 616 hectares across five sites |
| **Focus** | Geothermal vegetation protection |
| **Key Species** | Geothermal kanuka, native ferns |
| **Partnership** | Managed with iwi and community |

These sites protect rare geothermal vegetation communities found nowhere else in the world.

### Native Fish Programme

Our Native Fish Programme focuses on freshwater species in the lower Clutha Mata-au catchment:

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Total Area** | 7.07 hectares of riparian habitat |
| **Key Species** | Inanga, tuna, kanakana, giant kōkopu |
| **Activities** | Fencing, riparian planting, habitat restoration |
| **Partners** | DOC, landowners, volunteers |

## Native Tree Planting

Contact has made a strong commitment to native tree planting:

### FY25 Achievement

> **62,978 native trees planted in FY25**—exceeding our commitment to plant more than 20,000 indigenous plants annually.

### Our Planting Approach

We transform areas of exotic forest (once harvested) with indigenous species:
- Recently harvested 7 hectares of exotic forest
- Replanted the area with indigenous species
- Over 15,000 plants in a single project

This approach converts plantation forestry into permanent native forest, providing long-term habitat and carbon storage.

### Species Selection

Native plantings include:
- Kahikatea and tōtara (podocarp trees)
- Mānuka and kānuka (native shrubs)
- Harakeke (flax)
- Native grasses and ferns

## Pest Management

Introduced predators and pests are a major threat to New Zealand's native species. Contact operates pest control programmes across our sites:

### FY25 Achievement

> **3,871 pests removed in FY25** through ongoing control programmes

### Target Species

Our pest management focuses on:
- Possums (damage native trees, spread disease)
- Stoats and ferrets (prey on native birds)
- Rats (eat eggs and chicks)
- Feral cats (predators of native wildlife)

### Methods

We use a combination of:
- Trap networks
- Bait stations
- Monitoring to track effectiveness
- Collaboration with DOC and regional councils

## Native Fish and Eel Programmes

New Zealand's freshwater fish are among the most threatened in the world. Contact operates significant programmes to protect these species.

### Trap and Transfer Programme

Our hydroelectric dams can create barriers to fish migration. We address this through trap-and-transfer:

| Metric | FY25 Achievement |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Elver transferred** | 165 kg moved above Roxburgh Dam |
| **Adult tuna transferred** | 296 individuals |
| **Purpose** | Enable upstream migration |

This programme ensures tuna (eels) can complete their life cycle despite the presence of our dams.

### Habitat Restoration

Working with DOC, landowners, and volunteers, we enhance freshwater fish habitat through:
- Fencing to exclude stock from waterways
- Riparian planting to shade streams
- Reducing bank erosion and sedimentation
- Creating spawning habitat

## Threatened Species Focus

Contact's conservation efforts support species across threat classifications:

### IUCN Red List Species

| Classification | Species Count |
|---------------|---------------|
| Critically Endangered | 2 species |
| Endangered | 5 species |

### New Zealand Threat Classification

| Classification | Species Count |
|---------------|---------------|
| Nationally Critical | 2 species |
| Nationally Endangered | 4 species |

These include rare plants, freshwater fish, and native birds found at or near our sites.

## Conservation Partnerships

We can't protect biodiversity alone. Contact works with multiple partners:

### Department of Conservation (DOC)
- Joint projects on native fish
- Threatened species management
- Predator control coordination

### Wairakei Environmental Mitigation Charitable Trust (WEMCT)
- Management of restoration sites
- Geothermal vegetation protection
- Research and monitoring

### Iwi and Tangata Whenua
- Cultural guidance on species protection
- Traditional knowledge in restoration
- Partnership on taonga species

### Regional Councils and Community Groups
- Coordinated pest control
- Volunteer planting days
- Environmental monitoring

## Kiwi and Native Bird Protection

### Kiwi Contact Partnership

Contact partners with Save the Kiwi and Wairakei Golf + Sanctuary to protect New Zealand's iconic bird:
- Support for Taranaki Kiwi Trust since 2020
- Three-year sponsorship of education programmes
- Koko the kiwi sponsorship on Taranaki Maunga

### Karearea Release Programme

Contact supports the release of New Zealand Falcon (karearea) on Tūwharetoa iwi land:

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **Species** | Karearea (NZ Falcon) |
| **Location** | Tūwharetoa iwi land, Taupō |
| **Released so far** | 6 birds |
| **Target** | 15 birds total |
| **Population** | Fewer than 10,000 remain in the wild |

This partnership combines conservation science with cultural connection to the land.

## Community Conservation

### Greening Taupō

- Contact provided initial 3,000 seedlings in 2013
- Kicked off annual community planting days
- Improved environment for people and wildlife
