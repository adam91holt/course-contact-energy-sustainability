# Emissions and Science-Based Targets


![Emissions and Science-Based Targets](/courses/contact-energy-sustainability/assets/lesson-images/m2_05_emissions_targets.jpg)

Measuring and reporting emissions is fundamental to achieving our climate goals. Contact Energy was the first electricity company in New Zealand to adopt Science-Based Targets, demonstrating our commitment to credible, verifiable climate action. This lesson explains how we measure emissions and the targets that guide our decarbonisation journey.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Explain the three scopes of greenhouse gas emissions
- Describe Contact Energy's Science-Based Targets
- Understand our emissions reporting framework and methodology
- Recognise how we track progress toward our climate goals

## Understanding Greenhouse Gas Emissions

Greenhouse gases (GHGs) trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. The main GHGs from energy generation include:

- **Carbon dioxide (CO2)**: From burning fossil fuels and geothermal processes
- **Methane (CH4)**: From natural gas systems
- **Nitrous oxide (N2O)**: From combustion processes


## The Three Emission Scopes

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol—the international standard for emissions accounting—divides emissions into three scopes:

### Scope 1: Direct Emissions

These are emissions from sources we own or control:

| Source | Examples at Contact |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Combustion** | Natural gas burned in thermal power stations |
| **Process emissions** | CO2 released during geothermal steam extraction |
| **Fugitive emissions** | Leaks from gas systems |
| **Vehicle fleet** | Company cars and trucks |

Scope 1 emissions are within our direct control and are a primary focus of our net zero target.

### Scope 2: Indirect Energy Emissions

These are emissions from the electricity we purchase:

| Source | Examples at Contact |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Office electricity** | Power for lighting, computers, heating |
| **Operational electricity** | Power to run equipment at our sites |
| **Purchased energy** | Any electricity we buy from the grid |

While these emissions occur at someone else's power station, they result from our energy consumption.

### Scope 3: Value Chain Emissions

These are all other indirect emissions in our value chain:

| Category | Examples at Contact |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Purchased goods** | Emissions from manufacturing equipment |
| **Business travel** | Flights and accommodation |
| **Employee commuting** | Staff travel to work |
| **Use of sold products** | Emissions when customers use electricity we sell |
| **Fuel and energy activities** | Upstream emissions from fuel production |

> **Important:** Our net zero 2035 target covers scope 1 and 2 emissions. Scope 3 emissions will receive greater focus in the future as we expand our decarbonisation efforts across our value chain.

## Our Science-Based Targets

### What are Science-Based Targets?

Science-Based Targets (SBTs) are emission reduction goals that align with what climate science says is needed to limit global warming to 1.5°C—the goal of the Paris Agreement.

The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) independently verifies that a company's targets are:
- **Ambitious enough**: In line with climate science
- **Comprehensive**: Cover relevant emissions sources
- **Time-bound**: Have clear deadlines
- **Transparent**: Publicly reported

### Contact's Distinction

> **Key Achievement:** Contact was the first electricity company in New Zealand to set emission reduction targets through the Science Based Targets initiative.

This means our targets aren't just aspirational—they're independently verified as consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C.

### Our Verified Targets

| Target | Scope | Reduction | Deadline |
|--------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Greenhouse gas emissions | Scope 1 & 2 | 45% reduction | 2026 |
| Emissions from all sold electricity | Scope 1 & 3 | 45% reduction | 2026 |
| Emissions from use of sold products | Scope 3 | 34% reduction | 2026 |

These interim targets represent significant milestones on our path to net zero by 2035.

## Our Emissions Reporting Framework

### GHG Protocol Alignment

Contact voluntarily reports scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions aligned with the **Greenhouse Gas Protocol**—the global standard for emissions accounting. We've been doing this since 2018.

### Annual GHG Inventory Reports

We publish annual GHG Inventory Reports with:
- Detailed emissions data by scope and category
- Year-over-year comparisons
- Methodology explanations
- Independent assurance statements

Reports are available from FY21 onwards on our website, providing transparency and accountability.

### Independent Assurance

Our emissions data is independently assured, meaning:
- Third-party experts verify our calculations
- Methodology is checked against standards
- Data accuracy is validated
- Stakeholders can trust our reporting

## Tracking Our Progress

### Historical Emissions Reduction

Contact has made significant progress in reducing emissions:

| Metric | Achievement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Since 2012** | Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduced by almost 80% |
| **Since 2021** | 88% average renewable generation |
| **Last decade** | Generation emissions down 70% |
| **Equivalent impact** | Like removing 425,000 cars from roads |

### How We Achieved This

Our emissions reductions came through:

1. **Retiring thermal plants**: Three power stations closed
2. **Investing in renewables**: New geothermal, solar, and storage
3. **Improving efficiency**: Optimising existing operations
4. **Innovation**: Demand response and customer programmes

## Understanding Our Emissions Sources

### Thermal Generation

Our thermal power stations are our largest source of scope 1 emissions:
- Burn natural gas to generate electricity
- Used primarily for peak demand and system security
- Being reduced as renewable capacity increases

### Geothermal Process Emissions

Geothermal power isn't completely emission-free:
- Geothermal steam contains naturally occurring CO2
- This CO2 is released when steam is extracted
- Much lower than fossil fuel emissions
- We're exploring carbon capture and reinjection

### Vehicle Fleet

Our company vehicles contribute to scope 1 emissions:
- Service vehicles for site maintenance
- Company cars for staff
- Being transitioned to electric where possible

## Decarbonisation Pathways

### Immediate Actions

- **Renewable investment**: Tauhara, Kōwhai Park, Glenbrook battery
- **Thermal reduction**: Limiting thermal generation to essential system support
- **Efficiency improvements**: Optimising existing operations

### Medium-Term Actions

- **Carbon capture**: Investigating CO2 capture at geothermal sites
- **Fleet electrification**: Transitioning to electric vehicles
- **Demand response**: Helping customers shift consumption patterns

### Long-Term Actions

- **Complete thermal exit**: Phase out baseload thermal by 2035
- **Technology innovation**: Adopt emerging clean technologies
- **Supply chain engagement**: Work with suppliers to reduce scope 3

## Climate Risk and Opportunity

### Physical Risks

Climate change creates physical risks for our operations:
- **Water availability**: Affecting hydro and cooling systems
- **Extreme weather**: Damaging infrastructure
- **Temperature changes**: Impacting equipment efficiency

### Transition Risks

The shift to a low-carbon economy creates transition risks:
- **Policy changes**: New regulations and carbon pricing
- **Market shifts**: Changing customer preferences
- **Technology disruption**: New energy technologies

### Opportunities

Climate action also creates opportunities:
- **Renewable growth**: Increasing demand for clean electricity
- **Electrification**: New markets as transport and industry electrify
- **Green finance**: Access to sustainability-linked capital
- **Reputation**: Benefits from climate leadership

## Annual Climate Statement

Contact publishes an annual Climate Statement that details:
- How we think about climate change risks
- Our plans to mitigate these risks
- How we're taking advantage of opportunities
- Our governance of climate-related matters

This statement follows the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations.
