# Water Stewardship

Water is a precious taonga—a treasure for all New Zealanders to enjoy and protect. Contact Energy's operations depend on water resources, from hydroelectric generation to geothermal cooling. This lesson explores our comprehensive approach to water stewardship and our commitment to protecting New Zealand's freshwater ecosystems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Explain Contact Energy's Water Commitment and key principles
- Describe how we interact with water across our operations
- Understand our commitments regarding the Waikato River
- Identify water quality monitoring and protection programmes

## Water as Taonga

In Te Ao Māori, water (wai) is considered a precious taonga—something to be treasured and protected. Contact Energy shares this view.

### Our Water Commitment

Contact has developed a formal Water Commitment that outlines our dedication to water management. Key principles include:

- **Recognition**: We acknowledge the kaitiaki relationship between tangata whenua and water
- **Treaty principles**: We respect Treaty of Waitangi principles in all water-related activities
- **Stewardship**: We take responsibility for minimising our impact on freshwater ecosystems
- **Partnership**: We work alongside communities and stakeholders to improve water management

> **Core Belief:** Water is a resource for all New Zealanders to enjoy and look after. We recognise our responsibility to minimise our impact on Aotearoa New Zealand's freshwater ecosystems.

## How We Interact with Water

Contact's operations interact with water in several ways:

### Hydroelectric Generation

Our hydro dams on the Clutha Mata-au river system:
- **Use water flow** to generate electricity
- **Create lakes** that store water for generation
- **Affect sediment movement** through the river system
- **Impact fish migration** (addressed through mitigation programmes)

We monitor the Clutha Mata-au river continuously and implement mitigation measures for native fish migration.

### Geothermal Operations

Geothermal power stations interact with water through:
- **Geothermal fluid extraction**: Bringing hot water and steam to surface
- **Cooling systems**: Using water to cool equipment
- **Discharge management**: Treating and managing discharge water

### Thermal Generation

Our thermal stations on the Patea and Waikato Rivers:
- **Use river water** for cooling
- **Return water** at controlled temperatures
- **Manage discharge** to protect river ecosystems

### Office Operations

Even our offices interact with water:
- Kitchen and bathroom facilities
- Sourced from local council supplies
- Managed efficiently to minimise waste

## Waikato River Commitments

The Waikato River is one of New Zealand's most significant waterways, with deep cultural, ecological, and economic importance. Contact operates geothermal stations in the Waikato region and has made significant commitments regarding our impact on the river.

### Cooling Water Discharge

> **Key Commitment:** Contact will cease discharging cooling water into the Waikato River no later than **2031**.

This commitment represents a major change to our operations, requiring significant investment in alternative cooling solutions.

### Geothermal Water Discharge

As we develop plans for long-term operation of the Wairakei steamfield beyond June 2026, we will undertake environmental improvements:

> **Commitment:** We will cease the discharge of separated geothermal water to the Waikato River.

This means finding alternative ways to manage geothermal fluids that don't impact the river.

### Stakeholder Engagement

Our Waikato commitments involve extensive engagement with:
- Iwi and hapū with connections to the river
- Local communities
- Environmental groups
- Regional councils
- Other water users

## Water Quality Management

Contact implements comprehensive water quality management across our operations:

### Monitoring Programmes

| Site | Monitoring | Frequency |
|------|------------|-----------|
| Wairakei Geothermal | Hydrogen sulphide discharge | Weekly |
| Clutha Mata-au | River health indicators | Ongoing |
| All generation sites | Resource consent compliance | Continuous |

### Wairakei Monitoring

At our Wairakei Geothermal Power Station:
- Weekly limits monitor hydrogen sulphide discharge
- Qualified experts manage resource consent compliance
- Regular reporting to regulatory authorities

### Annual Environmental Impact Assessments

We conduct comprehensive annual assessments covering:
- Water takes and their effects
- Discharge quality and volumes
- Cumulative environmental impacts
- Compliance with consent conditions

## Native Fish Management Programme

Our Native Fish Management Programme in Central Otago provides valuable insights into ecosystem health:

### Programme Components

- **Population monitoring**: Tracking native fish numbers and distribution
- **Health assessment**: Using fish populations as indicators of river health
- **Habitat evaluation**: Assessing spawning and feeding areas
- **Research collaboration**: Working with scientists and iwi

### Key Species

The programme focuses on taonga species including:

| Species | Māori Name | Conservation Focus |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Longfin eel | Tuna | Migration support, population monitoring |
| Lamprey | Kanakana | Habitat protection |
| Inanga | Inanga | Spawning habitat restoration |
| Giant kōkopu | Kōkopu | Riparian habitat enhancement |

> **Insight:** Native fish species are excellent indicators of overall river health. A healthy fish population suggests good water quality and ecosystem function.

## Partnership Approach

### Kawarau Arm Community Project

Contact participates in the Kawarau Arm Community Project, working with local stakeholders to:
- Monitor water quality
- Protect native species
- Restore riparian vegetation
- Engage the community in water stewardship

### WAI Wānaka Partnership

Our new partnership with WAI Wānaka strengthens freshwater projects:
- Water quality monitoring
- Ecological restoration
- Advocacy for alpine lake health
- Community education and engagement

### Iwi Partnerships

We work with iwi on water management because:
- **Cultural significance**: Water has spiritual and cultural importance
- **Traditional knowledge**: Iwi hold valuable knowledge about waterways
- **Treaty obligations**: Partnership is a Treaty principle
- **Better outcomes**: Collaboration leads to better environmental results

## Resource Consent Compliance

Contact operates under resource consents that regulate our water use and discharge:

### Our Approach

- **Qualified experts** at each generation site manage compliance
- **Regular monitoring** against consent conditions
- **Transparent reporting** to regulatory authorities
- **Proactive engagement** when issues arise

### Key Compliance Areas

| Area | What We Manage |
|------|----------------|
| Water takes | Volume and timing of water extraction |
| Discharge quality | Temperature, contaminants, flow rates |
| Fish passage | Migration routes and barriers |
| Ecological effects | Impact on downstream ecosystems |

## Supply Chain Water Impacts

Our water responsibility extends beyond direct operations:

### Upstream Impacts

We consider water use in:
- Manufacturing of equipment and materials
- Transportation of goods
- Services provided by suppliers

### How We Address This

Through our responsible procurement programme, we:
- Assess supplier environmental practices
- Encourage water efficiency in our supply chain
- Prefer suppliers with strong environmental credentials

## Climate Change and Water

Climate change affects water availability and quality:

### Risks We Face

- **Changed rainfall patterns**: Affecting hydro generation
- **Increased droughts**: Reducing water availability
- **Temperature changes**: Impacting ecosystems
- **Extreme weather**: Causing floods and erosion

### Our Response

- Diversifying generation sources (not just hydro)
- Investing in water-efficient technologies
- Planning for different climate scenarios
- Building resilience into our operations

## Your Role in Water Stewardship

Everyone at Contact can contribute to water stewardship:

1. **Be water conscious**: Minimise water use in your work
2. **Report issues**: If you see water-related problems, report them
3. **Understand our commitments**: Know what we've promised regarding water
4. **Engage with purpose**: When speaking with stakeholders, communicate our water values
