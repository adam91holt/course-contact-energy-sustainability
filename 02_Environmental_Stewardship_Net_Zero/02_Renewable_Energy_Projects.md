Contact Energy is investing in a diverse portfolio of renewable energy projects to power New Zealand's clean energy future. From world-class geothermal stations to cutting-edge solar farms and battery storage, these projects are the foundation of our net zero strategy. This lesson explores our major renewable energy initiatives.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Describe Contact Energy's major renewable energy projects
- Explain the benefits of different renewable energy sources
- Understand the role of battery storage in the energy transition
- Recognise how these projects contribute to New Zealand's decarbonisation

## Our Renewable Energy Portfolio

Contact generates electricity from multiple renewable sources, each with unique characteristics:


| Source | Characteristics |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Geothermal** | Baseload, consistent 24/7 generation |
| **Hydro** | Flexible, dependent on rainfall |
| **Wind** | Variable, complements other sources |
| **Solar** | Daytime generation, seasonal variation |

This diversity provides reliability—when one source is limited, others can compensate.

## Geothermal: Our Baseload Powerhouse

Geothermal energy harnesses heat from deep within the Earth. New Zealand sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, giving us exceptional geothermal resources—particularly in the Taupō Volcanic Zone.

### Why Geothermal Matters

Geothermal is unique among renewables:
- **Baseload generation**: Operates 24/7, regardless of weather
- **High capacity factor**: Typically 90%+ availability
- **Low emissions**: Minimal carbon footprint compared to fossil fuels
- **Long asset life**: Plants can operate for decades

### Tauhara Geothermal Station

**Status**: Operational
**Capacity**: Powers approximately 200,000 homes
**Location**: Near Taupō

Tauhara is Contact's newest geothermal station and represents a major milestone in our net zero journey. Key features include:

- State-of-the-art technology for efficient steam utilisation
- Designed to minimise environmental impact
- Replaces fossil fuel generation capacity
- Built in partnership with local communities

> **Key Achievement:** Tauhara is now operational and ready to power 200,000 homes with clean, renewable geothermal energy.

### Te Huka Geothermal

Te Huka is another geothermal facility contributing to our renewable portfolio. The Te Huka 3 expansion further increases our geothermal capacity, demonstrating our ongoing investment in this reliable renewable source.

### Te Mihi Geothermal Station

Commissioned in 2014, Te Mihi represents modern geothermal excellence. It uses binary cycle technology for efficient energy extraction and maintains high availability for consistent generation.

### Combined Geothermal Impact

Together, Tauhara and Te Huka 3 add **1.9 TWh per annum** at full capacity—a massive contribution to New Zealand's renewable electricity supply.

## Kōwhai Park Solar Farm

Contact is building one of New Zealand's largest solar farms near Christchurch Airport.


### Project Overview

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Location** | Near Christchurch Airport, Canterbury |
| **Scale** | 300,000 solar panels |
| **Capacity** | Enough to power "four Riccartons" |
| **Construction** | Started late 2024 |

### Why Solar for New Zealand?

While New Zealand isn't traditionally associated with solar power, the technology has become increasingly viable:

- **Falling costs**: Solar panel prices have dropped dramatically
- **Canterbury sunshine**: The region receives good solar radiation
- **Daytime demand**: Solar generates during peak business hours
- **Complementary**: Generates when hydro lakes may be low (summer)

### Solar's Role in Our Mix

Solar complements our other generation sources:
- Generates during daylight hours when demand is high
- Produces most in summer when hydro resources may be lower
- Zero fuel costs once installed
- Minimal maintenance requirements

## Glenbrook Battery Storage

Battery storage is a game-changer for renewable energy. Contact is installing a Tesla Megapack battery system at Glenbrook, Auckland.

### Project Overview

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Technology** | Tesla Megapack battery system |
| **Location** | Glenbrook, Auckland |
| **Construction** | Begins 2025 |
| **Operational** | Expected 2026 |

### How Battery Storage Works

The Glenbrook battery will:

1. **Store excess energy**: When renewable generation exceeds demand, store the surplus
2. **Release during peaks**: Discharge stored energy during high-demand periods
3. **Provide grid services**: Help maintain system stability and frequency
4. **Reduce thermal reliance**: Meet peak demand without firing up gas plants

> **Key Benefit:** Battery storage allows us to use renewable energy generated during off-peak times to meet peak demand—reducing the need for thermal generation.

### Why Batteries Matter for Net Zero

Batteries address a fundamental challenge with renewables: variability. The sun doesn't always shine, and the wind doesn't always blow. Batteries provide:

- **Time-shifting**: Move energy from when it's generated to when it's needed
- **Rapid response**: React instantly to grid needs
- **Reduced curtailment**: Use renewable energy that might otherwise be wasted
- **Peak shaving**: Reduce dependence on peaking thermal plants

## Hydroelectric Generation

Contact operates hydroelectric facilities on the Clutha Mata-au river system in Central Otago.

### Clutha Hydro Scheme

Our hydro assets include:
- Clyde Dam
- Roxburgh Dam

Hydroelectric power provides:
- **Flexible generation**: Can ramp up or down quickly
- **Storage**: Water in lakes acts as stored energy
- **Long asset life**: Infrastructure lasts for generations
- **Zero fuel costs**: Only operating and maintenance expenses

### Balancing Variable Sources

Hydro's flexibility makes it ideal for balancing variable renewables:
- When solar generation drops at sunset, hydro can ramp up
- During wind lulls, hydro provides backup
- Lake storage acts as a massive "battery"

## Wind Energy

Wind power contributes to our renewable mix, taking advantage of New Zealand's excellent wind resources.

### Benefits of Wind

- **Abundant resource**: New Zealand has strong, consistent winds
- **Complementary timing**: Often windy when it's cloudy (less solar)
- **Zero fuel costs**: Wind is free
- **Scalable**: Modern turbines are increasingly efficient

## Supporting the Energy Transition

Our renewable projects support New Zealand's broader energy transition:

### Electrification Enabler

As New Zealand electrifies transport and industry, demand for electricity will grow. Our new renewable capacity ensures this increased demand can be met cleanly.

### Grid Decarbonisation

By adding renewable capacity and retiring thermal plants, we're reducing the carbon intensity of New Zealand's electricity grid—benefiting all electricity users.

### Economic Development

These projects create jobs and economic activity:
- Construction employment
- Ongoing operations roles
- Supply chain benefits
- Regional investment

## Innovation and Future Technologies

Contact continues to explore emerging technologies:

### Carbon Capture
Investigating ways to capture CO2 from geothermal operations and reinject it underground, further reducing our emissions footprint.

### Demand Response
Developing innovative products that help customers shift their electricity use to times when renewable generation is abundant.

### Green Hydrogen
Exploring the potential for using renewable electricity to produce green hydrogen—a clean fuel for hard-to-electrify sectors.
